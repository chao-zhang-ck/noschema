/**
  * This trait controls dependency injection of the logger implementation
  * Slf4j's logging interface is general enough, and it seems to be the future proof JVM standard.
  * However, its initialization is not transparent and flexible enough, due to its java heritage.
  * Here, the opportunity of reinventing a better wheel is exposed in more general way.
  * We may need multiple logger instances each controlled by its own explicit configuration
  * We also want to invoke logging as method of the mixin class
